# libwebp wrapper for .NET Standard 2.0

Forked and modified from [imazen/libwebp-net](http://github.com/imazen/libwebp-net)

The original library is available on Nuget as [Imazen.WebP](http://nuget.org/packages/Imazen.WebP).

This library offers P/Invoke exposure for webp/decode.h and webp/encode.h, but not demux.h and mux.h.

## Key APIs

* `new Imazen.WebP.SimpleDecoder().DecodeFromBytes(byte[] data, long length)` -> `System.Drawing.Bitmap`
* `new Imazen.WebP.SimpleEncoder().Encode(Bitmap from, Stream to, float quality)`
* `Imazen.WebP.SimpleEncoder.GetEncoderVersion() -> String`, `Imazen.WebP.SimpleDecoder.GetDecoderVersion() -> String`

## Improvements we're very interested in

* Expose the power of Imazen.WebP.Extern.WebPConfig and Imazen.WebP.Extern.WebPPreset for better encoding. 
* Consider using WebPDecode for better decode error details. 
* Animation support
* Make LoadLibrary cross-platform (although it is not strictly neccessary)
* Add .NET Core support. This will likely require introducing a PixelBuffer{width, height, ptr, stride} interface that can wrap System.Drawing.Bitmap via adapter. System.Drawing.Bitmap is currently directly used by the `SimpleDecoder` and `SimpleEncoder` classes, but these total < 200 lines of code. Or, leave the core API as P/Invoke only. libwebp doesn't have a bad API at all. 

## Windows builds of libwebp 0.5.2 can be found here:

You may need vcruntime14 (VS 2015 C++ Redistributable) https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145

This library is binary compatible with as-is NMake builds of libwebp (no custom C/C++).
